# Weather-Forecasting-Application
The Weather Forecast Application is a Java-based desktop application that allows users to fetch and display weather information for a specified location. The app uses the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve current weather data, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and pressure. The application also includes a search history feature and integrates with a MySQL database to store and retrieve weather data.
